# Back-end tech assessment

A production ready, maintainable, testable command-line application that
will calculate the ranking table for a league.

### Rules:

a draw (tie) is worth 1 point and a win is worth 3 points. A loss is worth 0 points.
If two or more teams have the same number of points, they should have the same rank and be
printed in alphabetical order (as in the tie for 3rd place in the sample data).

### Key development requirements:

-   CLI (with python)
-   Production ready
-   Testable
